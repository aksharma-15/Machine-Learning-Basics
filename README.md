# Machine-Learning-Basics for beginners
### Machine Learning Basics involves loading of the data, preprocessing the data, training a model, evaluating the model, and making predictions. The code which I've written demonstrates a simple machine learning workflow using logistic regression, which is a classifier. In machine learning, a classifier is a type of algorithm or model that is used for the task of classification. Classification is a supervised learning problem where the goal is to assign a category or label to a given input based on its features.
### I've used a simple dataset of the Iris flower which contains the characteristics of different Iris species. I've provided the code to predict the species of Iris on the basis of the charecteristics of the flower provided.
### I have provided the csv file named as IRIS along with the python script and its markdown format.
##### Hope this helps someone who is new to ML!
